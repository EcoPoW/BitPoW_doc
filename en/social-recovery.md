# Social Recovery

The blockchain brings the web to the cryptographic era. People used to register accounts everywhere on web2, which changes to Connect Wallet in web3. With the private key managed by the wallet, the assets can be transferred.

The blockchain is a permission-less bank without KYC. However, compared with the traditional bank, nobody can walk into the bank with his ID card and update his account password easily. When you lost your private key in crypto world, the assets have gone.



The identity in DeSoc is more important than how much you own. In the real world once the wallet is lost, you lose some money, but the social connections can help you making hard time. The social recovery in w3Connect is not designed as a password resetter, but it reduces the damage when the private key is exposed or missing. Social recovery makes the social identity and connections untransferrable.

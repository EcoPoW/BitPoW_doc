# Blockchain Storage

For quite a long time, blockchain projects relies on the IPFS for data storage, which is not on-chain. Since Filecoin and other blockchain-based infrastructures have been proposed for years, most NFTs are still hosted by IPFS, which indicates that the lightweight blockchain storage is on-demand.

In w3Connect, the first useful Proof of Work (rather than just the blockchain security) is equipped as the consensus engine. Moreover, the PoW computation is used for data replicating. The low specification devices can run the replication and proof algorithm easily. Everyone is allowed to contribute their spare resources for web3.
